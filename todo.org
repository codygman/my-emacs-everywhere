* TODO rebuild emacs with scenario based feature branches
** IN-PROGRESS verify emacs from source build is cached
*** [[https://travis-ci.org/github/codygman/my-emacs-everywhere/jobs/662777899?utm_medium=notification&utm_source=github_status][this build]] from [[orgit-rev:~/my-emacs-everywhere/::e42759f7b6216a8df3ab0bc945cacc4759c3e9fc][commit e42759f]] should cache it
*** okay I took the "nuclear" option and [[orgit-rev:~/my-emacs-everywhere/::ad3fd97e00ab9244413b54a920c74d4aed19a4d3][removed everything but emacs in another branch]]
**** [[https://travis-ci.org/github/codygman/my-emacs-everywhere/builds/662785175?utm_medium=notification&utm_source=github_status][build log]]
***** I would expect this one to use the cached one since other builds have built [[file:nixpkgs/emacs.nix::with import <nixpkgs> {};][emacs.nix]] and [[file:install.sh::nix-build emacs.nix | cachix push codygman4][pushed to cachix]]
